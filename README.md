# Similarity-Metrics-PCFGs
*** Made for a school project. Worked locally, then uploaded to GitHub. This is why there are only 3 commits. ***

Similarity Metrics:
- Used 3 different metrics to measure the similarity of words.
- Word similarities based on WordNet database of synsets, calling to specific senses each time.
- Program that employs the measurement algorithm is linked in cpsc422_2021w1_a4.

Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar
- Parses sentences into their parts of speech using PCFG models.
- Manually parse and calculate probabilities for each PCFG rule, then compare it to the measured probabilities.
